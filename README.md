# Flood Risk Prediction and Analysis Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting flood risk based on environmental and socio-economic factors using Machine Learning techniques. The main objective is to assess flood-prone areas and provide insights for climate risk and disaster management.  

This Week 2 milestone covers **data collection, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle Flood Prediction Dataset  
- **Link:** [Flood Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naiyakhalid/flood-prediction-dataset)  
- **Description:** The dataset contains 50,000 records with numeric features representing flood-related factors, such as Monsoon Intensity, River Management, Urbanization, Deforestation, and more.

## Week 2 Milestone Tasks
1. **Data Collection:** Downloaded the Kaggle dataset and extracted CSV files.  
2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Checked and handled missing values for numeric and categorical columns.  
   - Normalized numeric features where necessary.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Plotted feature distributions to understand the spread of flood risk factors.  
   - Generated correlation heatmap to identify relationships between variables.  
   - Created synthetic target variable (`flood_risk`) for modeling purposes.  
4. **Saved Preprocessed Dataset:** Ready for Week 3 model training.

## Improvisations Done
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to ensure quality and consistency.  
- Conducted detailed exploratory analysis with visualizations for better insights.  
- Generated a synthetic `flood_risk` label for classification in the upcoming model training.  
- Documented all steps clearly in the Jupyter Notebook for reproducibility.
